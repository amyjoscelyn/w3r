     w3r is a variant of the card game War, with a dash of Rock-Paper-Scissors mixed in.
     Each player starts with a full deck.  As in War, cards are flipped from each deck and pitted against each other.  Unlike War, each player in w3r is dealt a hand of three cards.  These three cards can be reordered (hold and drag to swap their positions).  When satisfied, tap and the opponent's cards will be revealed.
     Cards are evaluated one at a time, left to right, and in your perspective.  If your card is higher, you win that column (win_emoji).  If your card is lower, you've lost that column (loss_emoji).  If both cards are the same (war_emoji), there's a war!
     Wars are resolved immediately by drawing the first card from the top of the each deck.  These new cards are evaluated  again--win, loss, or war?  Once all columns have been decided as wins or losses, a winner of the round can be determined!
